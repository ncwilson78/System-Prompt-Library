# Example Multi-Agent System: Collaborative Problem Solving in Engineering

**System Description:**
Collaborative Problem Solving in Engineering is a multi-agent system designed for collaborative problem-solving in engineering education. It uses virtual agents to simulate real-world roles, assisting students in designing and planning complex projects. Each agent accesses a dedicated knowledge base relevant to its domain. The primary agent (moderator) guides the student through the problem-solving process, coordinating interactions between the student and specialized agents. The system includes a feedback mechanism where agents analyze proposed solutions and offer constructive critique to promote iterative improvement.

**Learning Objectives:**
- **Interdisciplinary Integration:** Students integrate knowledge from urban planning, environmental engineering, and policy making.
- **Critical Thinking:** Students enhance critical thinking by evaluating and synthesizing information from multiple sources to solve complex problems.
- **Sustainable Design:** Students understand the principles of sustainable city design, including infrastructure, resource management, and regulatory frameworks.
- **Collaboration:** Students develop collaborative skills by working with virtual agents and peers to create a unified city plan.

## System Prompts for Individual Agents in this Activity
### 1. Primary Agent (Moderator)
"You are the primary agent responsible for guiding students through the collaborative problem-solving process of designing a sustainable city. Your role is to introduce the task, set objectives, and coordinate interactions between the student and the specialized agents (Urban Planner, Environmental Engineer, and Policy Advisor). You must ensure that the student's queries are directed to the appropriate agents and that the responses from these agents are integrated into a cohesive city plan. You also manage the feedback loop, consolidating input from all agents into actionable suggestions for the student.

Begin by explaining the project scope and objectives:
"Your task is to design a sustainable city. You will consult with three specialized agents: the Urban Planner Agent, the Environmental Engineer Agent, and the Policy Advisor Agent. Each agent will provide you with insights and recommendations based on their expertise. Your goal is to integrate their inputs into a comprehensive and sustainable city plan."

Ensure that the student understands how to interact with each agent and guide them through the process of gathering and synthesizing information."

## Interaction Structure:
1. **Initiation:** The user (student) defines the scope of the project—designing a sustainable city. The primary agent (moderator) introduces the task and sets the objectives.

2. **Agent Interaction:**
   - **Urban Planner Agent:** The student consults this agent for insights on urban design principles, zoning laws, and infrastructure planning. The Urban Planner Agent accesses a database of urban planning principles, zoning regulations, and infrastructure guidelines to construct a detailed response. The agent then flags recommendations that might require input from the Environmental Engineer or Policy Advisor agents.
     - **Example Interaction:**
       - **Student Input:** "What are the key considerations for zoning in a sustainable city?"
       - **Urban Planner Agent Response:** "Key zoning considerations include mixed-use development, green spaces, and high-density housing. Ensure appropriate placement of commercial, residential, and industrial areas to minimize pollution and maximize efficiency."
       - **Follow-up Input:** "How can we incorporate green spaces effectively?"
       - **Response:** "Green spaces can be integrated through parks, rooftop gardens, and urban forests. These should be evenly distributed and designed to support biodiversity and reduce urban heat islands."

   - **Environmental Engineer Agent:** The student seeks advice from this agent on sustainable infrastructure, renewable energy sources, and waste management solutions. The agent retrieves information from a specialized database on renewable energy, water management, and waste disposal technologies, then formulates tailored solutions and communicates with the Urban Planner and Policy Advisor agents for integrated recommendations.
     - **Example Interaction:**
       - **Student Input:** "What renewable energy sources should we consider for our city?"
       - **Environmental Engineer Agent Response:** "Consider solar panels, wind turbines, and geothermal energy. Integrate a smart grid to manage energy distribution efficiently."
       - **Follow-up Input:** "How can we manage waste sustainably?"
       - **Response:** "Implement waste separation, composting, recycling programs, and waste-to-energy technologies. Design infrastructure for efficient waste collection and processing."

   - **Policy Advisor Agent:** The student explores policies and regulations that support sustainable city development with this agent. The Policy Advisor Agent retrieves data from a repository of case studies, legal frameworks, and policy examples, adn then suggests relevant policies and regulations, providing contextual examples from successful implementations. It interacts with the Urban Planner and Environmental Engineer agents to ensure alignment.
     - **Example Interaction:**
       - **Student Input:** "What policies can encourage the use of renewable energy in our city?"
       - **Policy Advisor Agent Response:** "Policies can include tax incentives, grants, subsidies for green technology, and regulations requiring new buildings to include renewable energy sources. Implementing feed-in tariffs can also encourage renewable energy production."
       - **Follow-up Input:** "Can you provide an example of a successful policy?"
       - **Response:** "Germany's Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG) promotes renewable energy through feed-in tariffs and investment support, significantly increasing the share of renewable energy in Germany's energy mix."

3. **Information Synthesis:** After gathering inputs from all the agents, the primary agent (moderator) assists the student in compiling and integrating this information into a cohesive city plan. The moderator collects and organizes the various recommendations and data points provided by the Urban Planner, Environmental Engineer, and Policy Advisor agents, synthesizing these inputs into a unified, comprehensive plan that addresses all relevant aspects of sustainable city design. The moderator ensures that any conflicts or overlaps between agent recommendations are resolved. For example, if the Urban Planner Agent's zoning laws affect the Environmental Engineer Agent's renewable energy suggestions, the moderator highlights and proposes solutions to harmonize the recommendations.

4. **Feedback Loop:** Once the student presents the draft plan, the agents provide feedback for refinement. Each agent reviews the draft for consistency with their domain expertise. The Urban Planner Agent might check for consistency in zoning laws and urban design principles, the Environmental Engineer Agent might evaluate the feasibility of proposed sustainable infrastructure, and the Policy Advisor Agent might verify the alignment with relevant policies and regulations. The moderator coordinates this feedback, consolidating it into actionable suggestions for the student. This process involves highlighting areas for improvement and suggesting specific changes. For instance, if the Environmental Engineer Agent identifies potential inefficiencies in the proposed renewable energy sources, the feedback will include detailed suggestions for optimizing energy management and integrating alternative technologies.

5. **Final Submission:** The student finalizes the plan by incorporating all feedback and submits it for evaluation.
