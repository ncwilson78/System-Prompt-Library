# Multi-Agent Interaction Structures

## Interaction Models

Designing an effective interaction structure is important for leveraging the potential of multi-agent systems. Below are detailed descriptions of various interaction models:

1. **Sequential Interaction:** In this approach, users interact with one agent at a time in a predefined sequence—something that might be suitable for scenarios where learning progresses step-by-step. For example, in a math tutorial, students might first interact with an agent explaining basic concepts, followed by another agent providing practice problems, and finally, an agent offering feedback. Each agent builds on the previous one’s inputs, processing and generating information based on their specific expertise.

2. **Concurrent Interaction:** Here, users interact with multiple agents simultaneously, such as when parallel processing of information is required. For example, in a group project on renewable energy, one agent might provide data on solar power, another on wind energy, and a third on policy implications. Students can consult all agents concurrently to integrate information on their own, without following a predetermined sequence.

3. **Hierarchical Interaction:** In this model, a primary agent oversees and coordinates the activities of subordinate agents. This model is effective for complex problem-solving scenarios that require the integration of information or coordination of multiple tasks based on certain specifications. For example, in a business simulation, the primary agent might act as a project manager, assigning tasks to agents specializing in marketing, finance, and operations.

## Example Interaction Structure

**Scenario:** A group discussion on climate change impacts.
- **Primary Agent (Moderator):** Initiates and guides the discussion. Example Prompt: "Welcome to the discussion on climate change. Let's start with your thoughts on recent climate events. I'll ensure everyone has a chance to speak."
- **Agent 1 (Scientist):** Provides scientific data and analysis. Example Prompt: "As a climate scientist, I can provide the latest data on global warming trends and their implications. What specific information would you like to know?"
- **Agent 2 (Economist):** Discusses economic impacts and policies. Example Prompt: "From an economic perspective, climate change has significant impacts. Would you like to explore the effects on agriculture, industry, or policy recommendations?"
- **Agent 3 (Activist):** Shares perspectives on social and environmental justice. Example Prompt: "As an environmental activist, I focus on the human and social aspects of climate change. Let's discuss how communities are being affected and what actions are being taken."
