# System Prompt Library

## Concept and Need
The System Prompt Library is envisioned as a dynamic, user-centered digital repository designed for educators. Its primary purpose is to provide a comprehensive collection of customizable prompts for [Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_pre-trained_transformer), tailored specifically for educational use. 

System prompts play a critical role in the design of learning technologies enabled by generative artificial intelligence (GenAI). As part of a GenAI-powered tool for learning and instruction, they are responsible for guiding learner interaction, [facilitating engagement and motivation](<Prompts/Teaching Activities/Student Engagement Enhancer GPT.md>), supporting pedagogical goals, [providing feedback and assessment](https://github.com/ncwilson78/System-Prompt-Library/blob/main/Prompts/Learning%20Activities/AI%20Mentor%20Gives%20Feedback.md), ensuring content accuracy and relevance, [encouraging reflective thinking and metacognition](https://github.com/ncwilson78/System-Prompt-Library/blob/main/Prompts/Learning%20Activities/PolicymakerGPT.md), facilitating adaptivity and personalization, and enhancing accessibility and inclusivity, among others. This site also outlines various [strategies for designing effective system prompts](https://github.com/ncwilson78/System-Prompt-Library/blob/main/About/02%20System%20prompts%20in%20education.md), such as incorporating examples, character creation, narrative engagement, self-generated prompts, and [sequential reasoning](https://github.com/ncwilson78/System-Prompt-Library/blob/main/Prompts/Learning%20Activities/Vector%20Explorer.md). 

## How to Use this System Prompt Library
This repository consists of several example [system prompts](<About/01 What is a system prompt.md>), created and shared by Harvard-affiliated educators and by experts in the field of GenAI and education, separated into prompts specifically for [educators](<Prompts/Teaching Activities>) and [learners](<Prompts/Learning Activities>). For each prompt, we have created a **breif summary** of the prompt's purpose and utility, summarized the **goals** of the prompt in ther form of specific learning objectives or instructional goals, provided a basic **structure** of the interaction each prompt affords, and curated relevant **additional materials**. Each section is intended to highlight the basic building blocks that go into [system prompt design for educational purposes](<About/02 System prompts in education.md>), and enable educators to [experiment with, adapt, and create system prompts](<Prompts/00 Adapting System Prompts for Your Context.md>) for their specific contexts. 

To use a specific prompt, simply copy it from the "Copy This Prompt" code block and paste it into your custom GPT tool.

Each of the prompts found in this repository is licensed for reuse, however, licensing models have different requirements. Make sure to check the specific licensing requirements before copying, adapting, or sharing a specific system prompt.

## Disclaimer
It is important to remember that Large Language Models (LLMs) can sometimes respond in ways we didn't anticipate, which might be unsuitable or not what you expected. We advise you to tailor these prompts to match the specific needs and backgrounds of your students and your teaching context. Please make sure to check the LLMs' responses to ensure they're appropriate and accurate. Use your best judgment and be cautious when using these prompts in your teaching.
